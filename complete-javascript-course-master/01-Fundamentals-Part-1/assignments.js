// JavaScript Fundamentals – Part 1
// LECTURE: Values and Variables
// 1. Declare variables called 'country', 'continent' and 'population' and 
// assign their values according to your own country (population in millions)
// 2. Log their values to the console

const country = "Philippines"
const continent = "Asia"
let population = 130

console.log(country)
console.log(continent)
console.log(population)

// LECTURE: Data Types
// 1. Declare a variable called 'isIsland' and set its value according to your
// country.The variable should hold a Boolean value.Also declare a variable
// 'language', but don't assign it any value yet
// 2. Log the types of 'isIsland', 'population', 'country' and 'language'
// to the console

const isIsland = true
//const language
console.log(typeof isIsland);
console.log(typeof population);
console.log(typeof country);
//console.log(typeof language);

// LECTURE: let, const and var
// 1. Set the value of 'language' to the language spoken where you live (some 
// countries have multiple languages, but just choose one)
// 2. Think about which variables should be const variables (which values will never 
// change, and which might change?). Then, change these variables to const.
// 3. Try to change one of the changed variables now, and observe what happens

const language = 'Filipino'


//language = 'English'


// Coding Challenge #1
// Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is
// calculated using the formula:
// BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height) (mass in kg
// and height in meter).
// Your tasks:
// 1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both
// versions)
// 3. Create a Boolean variable 'markHigherBMI' containing information about
// whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95
// m tall.
// const massMark = 78
// const heightMark = 1.69
// const massJohn = 92
// const heightJohn = 1.95

// § Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76
// m tall.

const massMark = 95
const heightMark = 1.88
const massJohn = 85
const heightJohn = 1.76

const calculateBMI = (mass, height) => {
    return mass / height ** 2
}

const markBMI = calculateBMI(massMark, heightMark)
const johnBMI = calculateBMI(massJohn, heightJohn)
const markHigherBMI = markBMI > johnBMI
console.log(markBMI, johnBMI, markHigherBMI);


// LECTURE: Basic Operators
// 1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population, 
// then how many people would live in each half?
console.log(population / 2);
// 2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console
population++
console.log(population);
// 3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than 
// Finland?
console.log(population > 6);
// 4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country 
// have less people than the average country?
console.log(population < 33);
// 5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
// which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million 
// people speak portuguese'
const description = `${country} is in ${continent}, and its ${population} million people speak ${language}`
console.log(description);



// LECTURE: Strings and Template Literals
// 1. Recreate the 'description' variable from the last assignment, this time
// using the template literal syntax

// I already did.


// Coding Challenge #2
// Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and 
// improve it.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Print a nice output to the console, saying who has the higher BMI. The message 
// is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
// 2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs. Example: "Mark's
// BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"
// Hint: Use an if/else statement �
// GOOD LUCK �

if (markHigherBMI) {
    console.log(`Mark's BMI (${markBMI}) is higher than John's (${johnBMI})!`);
} else {
    console.log(`John's BMI (${johnBMI}) is higher than Mark's (${markBMI})!`);
}


// LECTURE: Taking Decisions: if / else Statements
// 1. If your country's population is greater that 33 million, log a string like this to the
// console: 'Portugal's population is above average'. Otherwise, log a string like
// 'Portugal's population is 22 million below average' (the 22 is the average of 33
// minus the country's population)
// 2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to
// 130. See the different results, and set the population back to original

if (population > 33) {
    console.log(`${country}'s population is above average`)
} else {
    console.log(`${country}'s population is ${33 - population} below average`);
}

let value = 1
console.log('value', value++);

// LECTURE: Type Conversion and Coercion
// 1. Predict the result of these 5 operations without executing them:
// '9' - '5';
// '19' - '13' + '17';
// '19' - '13' + 17;
// '123' < 57;
// 5 + 6 + '4' + 9 - 4 - 2;
// 2. Execute the operations to check if you were right


'9' - '5'; // 4
'19' - '13' + '17'; // '617'
'19' - '13' + 17; // 23
'123' < 57; // false
5 + 6 + '4' + 9 - 4 - 2; // 1143

// LECTURE: Equality Operators: == vs. ===
// 1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like this: 
// prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country 
// have?');
// const numNeighbours = prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country have?');
// 2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality 
// == for now)
// 3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case 'numNeighbours'
// is greater than 1
// 4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when
// 'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value)
// 5. Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbours', including 1 and 0.
// 6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of
// 'numNeighbours'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why
// is this happening?
// Because numNeighbours is a string.
// 7. Finally, convert 'numNeighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now
// when you input 1
// When input 1, 'Only 1 border!'
// 8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this
// situation
// For data type accuracy.
// Type conversion to match the desired type.

// if (Number(numNeighbours) === 1) {
//     console.log('Only 1 border!');
// } else if (numNeighbours > 1) {
//     console.log('More than 1 border');
// } else {
//     console.log('No borders');
// }

// LECTURE: Logical Operators
// 1. Comment out the previous code so the prompt doesn't get in the way
// 2. Let's say Sarah is looking for a new country to live in. She wants to live in a 
// country that speaks english, has less than 50 million people and is not an 
// island.
// 3. Write an if statement to help Sarah figure out if your country is right for her. 
// You will need to write a condition that accounts for all of Sarah's criteria. Take 
// your time with this, and check part of the solution if necessary.
// 4. If yours is the right country, log a string like this: 'You should live in Portugal :)'. If 
// not, log 'Portugal does not meet your criteria :('
// 5. Probably your country does not meet all the criteria. So go back and temporarily 
// change some variables in order to make the condition true (unless you live in 
// Canada :D)

if (language === "English" && population < 50 && !isIsland) {
    console.log(`You should live in ${country} :)`);
} else {
    console.log(`${country} does not meet your criteria :(`);
}

// Coding Challenge #3
// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each 
// other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, 
// and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that 
// as well (draw means they have the same average score)
// 3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a 
// team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a 
// score of at least 100 points. Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum 
// score, as well as multiple else-if blocks �
// 4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when 
// both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 
// points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
// § Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
// § Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106
// GOOD LUCK �

// const aveDolphins = (96 + 108 + 89) / 3
// const aveKoalas = (88 + 91 + 110) / 3

// const aveDolphins = (97 + 112 + 101) / 3
// const aveKoalas = (109 + 95 + 123) / 3

const aveDolphins = (97 + 112 + 101) / 3
const aveKoalas = (109 + 95 + 106) / 3


if (aveDolphins > aveKoalas && aveDolphins >= 100) {
    console.log("Dolphins wins");
} else if (aveDolphins < aveKoalas && aveKoalas >= 100) {
    console.log("Koalas wins");
} else if (aveDolphins === aveKoalas && aveDolphins >= 100) {
    console.log("Draw");
} else {
    console.log("No team wins the trophy");
}



// Lecture 26

const day = 'monday';

if (day === 'monday') {
    console.log("Monday");

    console.log("Not a valid day");
}


// LECTURE: The switch Statement
// 1. Use a switch statement to log the following string for the given 'language':
// chinese or mandarin: 'MOST number of native speakers!'
// spanish: '2nd place in number of native speakers'
// english: '3rd place'
// hindi: 'Number 4'
// arabic: '5th most spoken language'
// for all other simply log 'Great language too :D'

const language2 = 'hindi'
switch (language2) {
    case 'chinese':
    case 'mandarin':
        console.log('MOST number of native speakers!');
        break;
    case 'spanish':
        console.log('2nd place in number of native speakers');
        break
    case 'english':
        console.log('3rd place');
        break
    case 'hindi':
        console.log('Number 4');
        break

        break
    default:
        console.log('Great language too :D');
        break;
}


// LECTURE: The Conditional (Ternary) Operator
// 1. If your country's population is greater than 33 million, use the ternary operator
// to log a string like this to the console: 'Portugal's population is above average'.
// Otherwise, simply log 'Portugal's population is below average'. Notice how only
// one word changes between these two sentences!
// 2. After checking the result, change the population temporarily to 13 and then to
// 130. See the different results, and set the population back to original

console.log(`${country}'s population is ${population > 33 ? 'above' : 'below'} average`);


// Coding Challenge #4
// Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a 
// restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 
// 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for 
// this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement � (If it's easier for you, you can 
// start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary 
// operator!)
// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value 
// (bill + tip). Example: “The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 
// 316.25”
// Test data:
// § Data 1: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430

const bill = 430
const tip = bill >= 50 && bill <= 300 ? bill * 0.15 : bill * 0.2

console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip}, and the total value ${bill + tip}`);
